# So you want to host a hack day?

[OpenNews](http://mozillaopennews.org) provides sponsorships to folks organizing hack days that work on real-world journalism problems. A lot of people, all over the world, are interested in holding events that bring together journalists, developers, designers, data specialists, and other folks excited about technology and journalism. This guide is meant to help organizers of events plan, execute, and document their hack days. Please contribute suggestions and contact OpenNews [if you'd like to host an event](https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/s/knight-mozilla-news-hack-day).

TL;DR
-Define your goals.
-Do what you gotta do to have fun meeting those goals.
-Reportback.

Create an organizing team and start planning. 2 people minimum. Cover main areas: hacks/hackers outreach; logistics; money; facilitation.

## Setting the stage, what can a hack day accomplish?

So, a hack day. There are a lot of different perceptions of hack days. The typical view is that of mute hackers furiously typing at computers, fueled by caffeine and adrenaline and after 24 or 48 hours they emerge with a magical thing, built out of fury and sweat and lack of sleep. Those events happen, but your event may bear little resemblance to that, and that's perfectly fine. What should your event look like? It's helpful to think about three key areas:

### Purpose
What do you *want* your hack day to accomplish? The answer to this question should motivate the rest of your work. and how you engage with this guide. For a tech company, they may want a hack day to help spread the word about a new tool or [API](link). Contrary to popular belief, the purpose of your hack day is unlikely to be to build a brand new widget whatsit from scratch. Some great, and realistic, purposes include: [building a sense of community](link to zzolo's piece), [building connections between teams](link to keefe's piece), fostering a better understanding of the work other groups do(link to hackjersey). 

In the process of achieving those goals, teams will do excellent work together and may even have a fancy new tool to show off at the end. But, it's useful to keep in mind that demos are not the end all be all of a hack day. You get to decide what you want to get done during the day you're organizing. And we're always available to help you talk through realistic expectation setting.

### Theme
Hack the news! Well, that's pretty broad. It can be helpful for you as an organizer and for participants to have a more specific event theme. It can be a particular topic, such as newsgaming, a question, a geographic area, a data set, it's really up to you. A more specific theme can help you focus recruitment for speakers and participants, and it helps direct the brainstorming for teams. You can also experiment with the theme. [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://rhok.org) for example, is pretty broad: hacking for social good, but every event includes partner organizations that come with ideas and data sets. It gives focus, but also allows for flexibility.

### Audience
Skills, experience, enthusiasm.
So who do you want to have at your event? You know the community you're organizing for best. You should be in touch with them as you're developing the purpose and theme for your event and then come the invitations. The importance of personal invitations cannot be overstated. You probably have some people in mind who you'd love to have at your event. Invite them. It can be a good idea to get a core group of folks committed before you even publicly announce the date so you know ahead of time about possible conflicts and know for sure that you'll have some attendees.

You'll also probably want to do an open invitation. In thinking about the composition of your event overall, you'll want to consider three main areas:
* Skills: The ratio of participants is a critical part of the success of a journalism hack day. A good ratio to aim for is 2 developers for every 1 journalist. Even for an event that is meant to appeal to journalists, this ratio helps ensure that teams will be able to work together in such a way that everyone is able to contribute and no team member is overtaxed.
The more detail you can get about the skills of your attendees, the better. It's pretty common for there to be fewer designers/front-end devs than back-end devs. You may want a lot of data gurus at your event. Think about the skills you'll need for the types of projects teams will be working on, and build that into the event registration. You can manage the ratio of attendees by asking people to self identify when they register for the event, and monitoring the number of different participant types. 
* Experience: If you're expecting a lot of new folks, be sure to also invite some more experienced folks and ask if they'd be willing to help in a mentor-type role. If you're expecting a lot of folks who regularly attend hack days, keep that in mind when developing the agenda for the day. The experience level with hack days, independent of skill level, can change how you approach designing your event.
* Enthusiasm: In thinking about the purpose of your event, what deliverables do you want? It's helpful to have some "enthusiasm ringers" in the crowd, folks who can really help drive the excitement about collaborating or, if you're attempting a longer-term event, keep an eye on how to move projects along after the event. Why do participants want to attend your event? To work with a team they already know? To gain a skill? To meet new people? To save journalism? Getting to know what your community is enthusiastic about will also help shape the event.


## How to get started with planning

## Where to go for help
You don't have to reinvent the wheel and you do not have to figure out all the minuetia yourself. What you need help with will vary depending on your organizing team's skillset. Your goal should be to have an event that meets the goals you and your community have laid out. You don't have to follow anyone else's definition of what a hack day is, but, if you want tips and suggestions, they abound:
Examples of other guides
hack jam guide
hackweekends guide
hack day manifesto
check local community
data kind
Also, don't get too wrapped up with the whole hack day thing. It's an event with people who want to have fun and do some good work. That describes a lot of types of events. If you know that people love X type of food at every other event you've gone to but you've only ever seen pizza at hack days, order the food you love. You don't have to serve pizza and Red Bull.

## So, what are your options for formats?
These are some examples with a few thoughts on each format. Pick the one that seems like it'll meet your needs and is feasible with the level of planning/financial support you have.

### One-day event
* Typically a full-day, weekend event. Sometimes with a couple hour evening meet and greet the night before.
* Great for community-focused events, first timers, and events with limited time.
* Not as great for actually building stuff. In a day, after groups form, problems are identified, there just isn't that much time to actually get to the hacking part of the day. 
* Good option when people might commute a fair distance for the event, but not have funds for hotel.
### Weekend event
* Probably the most common hack day format. Full-days on Saturday and Sunday, sometimes with an evening pre-event on Friday.
* Wide variation in what it means to take up the entire weekend. Some events follow a semi-work day, some events are 48-hours of hack hack hacking.
* Can be extremely taxing on the organizing group, especially if the event goes overnight. 
* Weekend is a good amount of time to make progress on a project and get it to a point where a team can decide if they'll keep at it after the hack day or let it go. 
* Weekend can strain teams that aren't in the best shape. A day is over before it begins, but a weekend can really drag if the team doesn't gel/can't pick a topic/doesn't have a good mix of skills to delegate tasks.

### Public event
* Most events are completely open to the public. You should personally invite some folks, but most events also have an open call.
* Great for building connections across different groups.
* Can be a great way for an organization to show off its space, its ideas, its leadership, etc.
* There can be a lot of unknowns, and the events require close watch of event registrations to make sure it's a good mix of folks.
* Requires a critical mass of community members. Ideally, a hack day happens after a series of other events that have established interest from developers and journalists in the local community. It's tremendously difficult to pull of an event in an area without an existing community to support, and participate, in the efforts.

### Internal event
* Can be a great way to spark leadership interest and demonstrate cross-team collaboration.
* Lots of great examples from outside of journalism, but increasingly within journalism as well, NYC, NPR, WNYC, Boston Globe etc
* Can be a way to test out and guage interest in larger events and foster buy-in for a public event.
* Often takes place during the work day, on a single weekday.

### Hybrid event
* Some organizations host events that are primarily attended by staff, but also open to the public. 
* Can be a good way to ensure that there is a baseline of participants
* Can be great way to get news org connected to broader community, and help community learn more about news org. 
* Sometimes encounters sticky issues of who owns a story [see parking lot](link)

### Multi-location event
* Some events take place in several cities at the same time, RHoK, Developing Latin America, etc. 
* Gives chance for people in many places to participate, but can be logistically very challenging.

### Misc formats
* TechCamps - weekend event with neat mix of teaching/learning with hacking
* Editors' Labs - weekend event, also, mix "master class" sessions with hands-on hacking
* AOP Hack Day - look at my notes
* Open Data Day - a scrape-a-thon
* Documentation-a-thon 
* Start-a-thon
* SEPTA hack days, topical themes.

**Note**: Remote assistance. Sometimes, a team has a question that no one physically present can answer. Or a team member can only participate in person for part of the event. Or someone wants to join in, but can't make it to the space. Some events are experimenting with having more remote participants. These partiicpants can help a ton in a pinch -- connecting via Twitter, IRC, email, sometimes even Skype -- but it can make the community building aspect of a hack day more challenging. If it seems that a lot of participants won't be able to attend in person, look at if a different day or style of event might be better. Participants don't have to sign their lives away for a weekend, but there is definitely a sense of camraderie that comes from working with a group at the same table for hours on end.

# Nuts and bolts of planning, marketing, setting up event
## Location
You gotta find a place and set a date. Where to hold the event? Where have you attended similar events? Contact the organizers of those events and see what suggestions they have. If possible, strike a sponsorship deal with the space so that you promote their space with your event details and they give you access to the space for free/low cost. Some good places to start looking for spaces:
* the companies of news orgs or tech companies 
## Registration
## Promotion
partnerships
personal invitations
## Food

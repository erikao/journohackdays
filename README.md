# So you want to host a hack day?

So, a hack day. There are a lot of different perceptions of hack days. The typical view is that of mute hackers furiously typing at computers, fueled by caffeine and adrenaline and after 24 or 48 hours they emerge with a magical thing, built out of fury and sweat and lack of sleep. [Those events happen](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_hackathons/all/1), but your event may bear little resemblance to that, and that's perfectly fine. What should your event look like? 

### A successful event involves three main elements:

* **Define your goals.**
What do you *want* your hack day to accomplish? You can help answer that question by thinking about the purpose, theme, and audience of your event. (Psst: [building community](http://zzolo.org/thoughts/what-hackathons-really-are) is a great, and realistic, purpose for your event.)

* **Do what you gotta do to have fun meeting those goals.**
The main thing to keep in mind is that once you have your goal defined, trust yourself that you know how to help your participants have fun and meet that goal. To that end, there are a ton of existing guides to help you figure out the details of how to actually manage the logistics of one of these events. Examples include, [Mozilla's hack jam guide](https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/guides/hack-jam/), the [Hack Weekends Guide](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide), [The Hack Day Manifesto](http://hackdaymanifesto.com/). These guides are great for details and suggestions (and this guide will include additional logistical tips soon, too). 

* **Reportback.**
Close the loop. Did you meet your goals? Did you learn something from organizing the event? Share out what you learned. Examples from [HackJersey](http://blog.tommeagher.com/2013/04/organizing-my-first-hackathon/), [Hacks for Democracy](http://www.azavea.com/blogs/atlas/2012/10/hacks-for-democracy-wrapup-reflections/), [Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/04/19/what-we-learned-hosting-three-chicago-crime-hacks/).

This is a work-in-progress guide to help event hosts plan, organize, and facilitate events. This guide will be built out with more details and examples, but all of the documentation will grow from this framework: set your goals, trust that you know how to meet them, and then share what you learn.

### Why am I writing this?

I work for [OpenNews](http://mozillaopennews.org). We provide sponsorships to folks organizing hack days that work on real-world journalism problems. A lot of people, all over the world, are interested in holding events that bring together journalists, developers, designers, data specialists, and other folks excited about technology and journalism. This guide is meant to help organizers of events plan, execute, and document their hack days. Please contribute suggestions and contact OpenNews [if you'd like to host an event](https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/s/knight-mozilla-news-hack-day).
